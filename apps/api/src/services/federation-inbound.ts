/**
 * Federation Phase 3 — inbound `POST /_federation/event` dispatcher.
 *
 * Responsibilities (in order):
 *   1. Validate that the envelope is shaped enough to extract `fromInstance` +
 *      `eventType` + `nonce` (so we can fail fast before any signature work).
 *   2. Look up the `RemoteInstance` keyed on `fromInstance`. Peer MUST be in
 *      `status='peered'`. Anything else → 403 (`peer not peered`).
 *   3. Resolve the author's public key. We try `RemoteUser.publicKey` first; on
 *      cache miss we call `FederationProfileService.fetchRemoteProfile` which
 *      hits the peer's `.well-known` + posts a `profile.request`. The cache
 *      lookup uses the qualified id pulled out of the payload, so we have to
 *      peek at the (validated-shape but not yet signature-checked) payload to
 *      get it. That peek is by EVENT TYPE — each handler declares where the
 *      author id lives in its payload (see `extractAuthorRemoteUserId`).
 *   4. Call `verifyTwoLayerMessageEnvelope` with BOTH keys + the appropriate
 *      Zod schema. This is the single point that checks both signatures, the
 *      replay window, the payload shape, and the timestamps. On instance-
 *      signature failure ONLY, retry with the peer's `previousInstanceKey`
 *      (rotation overlap) before declaring `bad_signature`.
 *   5. Open a transaction; insert the envelope-log row FIRST. The
 *      `unique(peerInstanceId, nonce)` constraint is the replay protection —
 *      a duplicate raises Prisma `P2002` which we translate to 409.
 *   6. Dispatch to the event-type handler INSIDE the transaction. The handler
 *      does all its writes via the transactional `tx` client, so if it fails
 *      for an unrecoverable reason the envelope-log insert rolls back too —
 *      otherwise the peer's retry would collide with the unique nonce and
 *      the message would be permanently lost.
 *   7. After the transaction commits, run the handler's `postCommit` hook —
 *      gateway broadcasts and `RemoteUser.lastSeenAt` cache touch. Both
 *      MUST be outside the transaction so clients never see an event for a
 *      row that rolled back, and the cache touch survives rollbacks.
 *
 * Why a dispatcher map: P3-8 (message.update + message.delete) and P3-9
 * (reaction.add + reaction.remove) both register handlers by adding a key to
 * `HANDLERS`. The route shell, signature verification, peer lookup, and
 * envelope-log write all stay in this file — they're not duplicated per
 * event type. As of P3-8 the map carries `message.create`, `message.update`,
 * and `message.delete`; reactions land in P3-9.
 *
 * Critical: this module is INBOUND-ONLY. It never calls `fanOutMessageCreate`
 * or any other outbound helper. There is no message relay in Phase 3 — every
 * peer receives the envelope directly from the home instance. The
 * `originInstanceId != null` marker on the persisted Message row is what
 * distinguishes a federated row from a local one, and the outbound fan-out
 * gate in `routes/messages.ts` is keyed on the local create route, never on
 * an inbound persist.

 * The peer (B) is asking us (A, the home of a federated invite) to redeem
 * a code. The envelope's two-layer signature has already proved (a) the
 * peer's instance signature checks out and (b) the joiner's user
 * signature over the payload checks out — so we know who is asking and
 * from which instance.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. Look up the invite. Must exist, must be federated, must point at
 *      a real Server.
 *   2. Apply validity gates (revoked / expired / exhausted) → 410.
 *   3. Apply scope gates:
 *        - any_peer        → no extra check (peer is peered already)
 *        - specific_instance → invite.remoteInstanceHost === peer.host
 *        - specific_user   → invite.remoteUserId === joinerRemoteUserId
 *      Anything mismatched → 403.
 *   4. Materialise the joiner as a local synthetic User via
 *      `ensureUserForRemoteUser`. The user-layer signature already
 *      established their public key, so we use the RemoteUser row
 *      resolved upstream.
 *   5. Attempt `ServerMember.create` and catch P2002 — this is the
 *      idempotency boundary. If the joiner is already a member, we
 *      skip the `invite.uses` increment.
 *   6. If the member was newly created, atomically increment
 *      `invite.uses` (conditional updateMany so a concurrent join can't
 *      push us past maxUses).

// --- mirror lifecycle handlers (P4-8) ---------------------------------------

/**
 * Shared author resolver for the four mirror-lifecycle envelopes
 * (server.update + channel.create/update/delete). Used as the handler's
 * `resolveAuthorRemoteUserId` callback — runs BEFORE crypto.
 *
 * Responsibilities, in order:
 *   1. Pull the target server id from the payload (the key differs only
 *      structurally; the field is named `serverId` on every mirror payload).
 *   2. Look up the mirror Server row and verify it actually IS a mirror
 *      (`originInstanceId != null`) → otherwise 404 `unknown_mirror_server`.
 *      A LOCAL server matching the id is treated the same as a missing one:
 *      we never mutate a local server in response to a peer envelope.
 *   3. Verify the peer that sent the envelope is the mirror's origin
 *      (`originInstanceId === peer.id`) → otherwise 403 `not_origin`. This
 *      is the core security check for these handlers: only the home peer
 *      can push mutations for a Server it owns.
 *   4. Resolve the mirror Server's owner User row and return their
 *      `remoteUserId` (the qualified `<localpart>@<peerHost>` id). The
 *      owner is by definition a synthetic mirror user — `User.remoteUserId`
 *      is populated — so this lookup is just a field read.
 *
 * Throwing `FederationInboundError` here is the canonical place to surface
 * the early-fail conditions: the dispatcher catches them and routes to the
 * appropriate HTTP status without performing any signature verification.

 *   - the sending peer is the mirror's origin (`not_origin` otherwise),

 *      cache miss does a `fetchRemoteProfile` + upsert).
 *   2. Calls `addMirrorMember`, which synthesises a local User row if
 *      needed and inserts a `ServerMember`. Idempotent — a duplicate
 *      envelope hits the P2002 short-circuit inside the mirror helper
 *      and returns the existing local user id.
 *   3. Post-commit broadcasts `MEMBER_ADD` to any local clients viewing
 *      the mirror, and touches `RemoteUser.lastSeenAt` for the envelope
 *      author (the mirror owner — the one who signed the announcement).
 *
 * Critically: we do NOT fan out `member.add` to other peers from here.

/**
 * Inbound `dm.create` (P5-4).
 *
 * Peer B is announcing that one of its users has opened a 1:1 DM with one
 * of our users. Symmetric counterpart of the outbound `fanOutDmCreate`
 * (P5-3). Behaviour:
 *
 *   1. Capability gate — peer MUST advertise `dms` in the negotiated
 *      capability set. Unlike server-message federation the `dms`
 *      capability is opt-in per instance; a peer that's peered for
 *      messages-only gets a hard 403 (NOT a 501) so the sender knows the
 *      DM didn't land and can surface it to its user. This mirrors the
 *      defensive posture of `fanOutDmCreate`, which short-circuits on the
 *      send side when the peer doesn't advertise `dms`.
 *
 *   2. Recipient resolution — `payload.recipientRemoteUserId` has the form
 *      `<localpart>@<host>`. The host MUST match `selfHost` (the peer is
 *      targeting THIS instance), and the localpart MUST resolve to a
 *      local User row via `usernameLower`. Either failure → 404
 *      `unknown_recipient` (we don't disclose which leg failed).
 *
 *   3. Initiator mirror — the initiator's RemoteUser row was already
 *      resolved by the dispatcher (cache hit OR profile-fetch). We
 *      materialise the matching local synthetic User row via
 *      `ensureUserForRemoteUser` so we have a real `User.id` to slot into
 *      DmChannelMember.
 *
 *   4. PairKey collision rules — there are TWO ways a DmChannel can
 *      collide here, and each surfaces as 409 `dm_channel_conflict`:
 *        (a) a DmChannel with this `pairKey` already exists under a
 *            DIFFERENT id. Treating this as anything other than 409 would
 *            corrupt federation state — both sides would end up with
 *            divergent dmChannelIds for the same conversation.
 *        (b) a DmChannel with the same `id` (payload.dmChannelId)
 *            already exists but represents a DIFFERENT pair. This is a
 *            ULID collision (vanishingly unlikely but possible) or a
 *            peer-side bug; either way we refuse to overwrite the
 *            existing row.
 *      If the existing row matches BOTH the proposed id AND the
 *      computed pairKey, treat as idempotent re-delivery (200) — the
 *      peer is re-sending a previously-accepted envelope (e.g. retry
 *      after a transient failure on their side). This is the same
 *      idempotency posture as `findOrCreateDirectDm`.
 *
 * Federation note: this handler runs on the RECEIVING side. The
 * federation envelope's `originInstanceId` is the peer's `peer.id`, but
 * Tavern's `DmChannel` schema doesn't carry an originInstanceId column
 * (DMs are inherently two-sided — both ends are "home" of the channel).
 * We persist the channel as a normal local row; the federated nature is
 * implicit in the participant set (one local User + one mirror User with
 * `remoteUserId IS NOT NULL`).

/**
 * P5-6 — inbound `dm.message.create`.
 *
 * Mirrors `handleMessageCreate` (server-channel send) with the
 * server-membership invariant swapped for DmChannel membership:
 *
 *   1. Peer must advertise `dms` — same capability gate as `dm.create`.
 *   2. DmChannel must exist locally. If not, the peer beat us with a send
 *      before we accepted their `dm.create` (or that envelope was dropped).
 *      404 `unknown_dm_channel` rather than lazily creating a channel —
 *      pair derivation needs both qualified ids, which this payload
 *      doesn't carry, and inferring the missing side from `peer.host` +
 *      our local recipient guess would risk a wrong pairing.
 *   3. Author's local synthetic User row must already exist (materialised
 *      by `dm.create`'s `ensureUserForRemoteUser` call) AND must be a
 *      `DmChannelMember` of the target channel. Anything else is a
 *      peer-side bug.
 *   4. Idempotent on `Message.id` — the sender's ULID is re-used so a
 *      retry after a transient receiver failure dedups cleanly. The
 *      envelope-log replay window catches most retries earlier, but this
 *      second layer catches replays from outside the window.
 *
 * `lastMessageAt` is bumped INSIDE the transaction (atomic with the
 * Message insert) so the DM list never sorts a row above its committed
 * message. PostCommit handles the gateway broadcast + `lastSeenAt`
 * touch — both fire-and-forget by contract.
